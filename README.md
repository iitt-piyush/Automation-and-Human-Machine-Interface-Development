# Automation and Human Machine Interface (HMI) Development

This repository showcases a comprehensive project on **Industrial Automation and HMI Development**, integrating **PLC Ladder Logic**, **simulation environments**, and **real-time Human-Machine Interface (HMI) design**.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project simulates and demonstrates the design, control, and monitoring of an industrial process using:

- ✅ PLC Ladder Logic Programming  
- ✅ HMI Screen Design for User Interaction  
- ✅ Real-time simulation of industrial process control  
- ✅ Alarm management, system feedback, and process automation  

The purpose is to replicate a realistic industrial environment and demonstrate core control system principles used in industries like manufacturing, water treatment, conveyor systems, and more.
